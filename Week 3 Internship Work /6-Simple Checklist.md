# Secure Application - Best Practices

This project demonstrates essential security best practices for web applications. It provides a reference checklist to ensure your application remains secure against common attacks.

---

## Security Best Practices Checklist

### 1. Validate all inputs

* Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection, XSS, etc.
* Use libraries or frameworks that help sanitize inputs.

### 2. Use HTTPS for data transmission

* Always use HTTPS to encrypt data between client and server.
* Obtain an SSL certificate and configure your web server.

### 3. Hash and salt passwords

* Never store passwords in plain text.
* Use strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
* Add a unique salt to each password before hashing.

### 4. Implement proper authentication and authorization

* Use secure authentication methods (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
* Verify user permissions for sensitive operations.

### 5. Use secure headers

* Add HTTP security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options).
* Protect your app against clickjacking, XSS, etc.

### 6. Handle errors securely

* Don’t expose sensitive information in error messages.
* Log errors internally for debugging.

### 7. Keep dependencies updated

* Regularly update libraries and packages to fix vulnerabilities.
* Use tools like `npm audit` to check for security issues.

### 8. Set up logging and monitoring

* Log security-relevant events.
* Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
